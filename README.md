# Decoder Ring

## Context 
An application that encodes and decodes messages. 

## User
Anyone who is interested in playing with a decoder! Children would likely be the common demographic.

## Features
Three different ciphers: 
 • Caesar
 • Polybius
 • Substitution 
 
## Technologies and Tools 
 • Vanilla JS
 • Array methods
 
 ## Discoveries 
I learned how to set a limit using an object with two values. I also learned about UTF-16 and some methods associated with it. 

## Future Goals
I would like to return to this code and refactor it. I also would like to investigate other approaches to creating the same ciphers to see if any of them might make more sense than the approaches I took.
